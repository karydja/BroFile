# [WIP] FileSync
Java project developed for Distributed Programming class at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, under the guidance of professor [Handerson Medeiros](https://sigaa.ufrn.br/sigaa/public/docente/portal.jsf?siape=2278805).

## What is it about?
The general ideia is: using FileSync, you should be able to sync the files under some directory with other users, like a Dropbox shared folder.
